# LeCritique Analytics Design

## Overview
Since questionnaires are dish-specific and can vary completely between restaurants, we need analytics that provide insights at the question level, not just overall ratings.

## Basic Analytics (All Tiers)

### 1. Question Scores
- Average rating per question per dish
- Response count per question
- Basic score trends (last 7/30 days)

### 2. Dish Performance
- Overall dish rating (weighted average)
- Feedback completion rate
- Top/bottom 3 performing dishes

### 3. Simple Visualizations
- Bar charts for question scores
- Star rating distribution
- Basic time series (daily averages)

### 4. Text Response Summary
- Most frequent keywords
- Positive/negative mention counts
- Recent feedback list

## Advanced Analytics (Professional/Enterprise)

### 1. Comparative Intelligence
- Cross-dish attribute comparison
- Question correlation analysis
- Performance benchmarking

### 2. Predictive Insights
- Trend forecasting per question
- Customer satisfaction predictions
- Churn risk indicators

### 3. AI-Powered Analysis
- Sentiment analysis with nuance
- Theme extraction from responses
- Automated improvement suggestions
- Question effectiveness scoring

### 4. Advanced Visualizations
- Radar charts for multi-attribute analysis
- Heat maps for time/day patterns
- Interactive dashboards
- Custom report builder

### 5. Segmentation
- Customer segment analysis
- Demographic insights (if collected)
- Repeat vs new customer patterns
- Channel performance (dine-in vs takeout)

## Implementation Priority
1. Question-level metrics (critical for value proposition)
2. Basic visualizations
3. Text response analysis
4. Advanced comparative views
5. AI-powered insights
