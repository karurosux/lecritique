# LeCritique Microservices-Ready Architecture

## 🏗️ Current Domain Structure

The project has been restructured following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and is ready to be split into microservices. Each domain is self-contained with its own models, services, repositories, and handlers.

### 📦 Domain Organization

```
domains/
├── auth/                    # Authentication & User Management
│   ├── models/             # Account, User, TeamMember entities
│   ├── services/           # AuthService (login, register, JWT)
│   ├── repositories/       # AccountRepository
│   └── handlers/           # HTTP handlers for auth endpoints
│
├── restaurant/             # Restaurant Management
│   ├── models/            # Restaurant, Location, Settings
│   ├── services/          # RestaurantService
│   ├── repositories/      # RestaurantRepository
│   └── handlers/          # Restaurant CRUD handlers
│
├── menu/                  # Menu & Catalog Management
│   ├── models/           # Dish, Category
│   ├── services/         # DishService
│   ├── repositories/     # DishRepository
│   └── handlers/         # Menu management handlers
│
├── feedback/             # Feedback & Survey System
│   ├── models/          # Feedback, Questionnaire, Question
│   ├── services/        # FeedbackService
│   ├── repositories/    # FeedbackRepository, QuestionnaireRepository
│   └── handlers/        # Feedback submission handlers
│
├── qrcode/              # QR Code Management
│   ├── models/         # QRCode, QRCodeScan
│   ├── services/       # QRCodeService
│   ├── repositories/   # QRCodeRepository
│   └── handlers/       # QR code generation/validation
│
└── subscription/        # Billing & Subscriptions
    ├── models/         # Subscription, SubscriptionPlan
    ├── services/       # SubscriptionService (coming soon)
    └── repositories/   # SubscriptionRepository
```

### 🔗 Shared Components

```
shared/
├── config/         # Configuration management
├── database/       # Database connection utilities
├── models/         # BaseModel, Pagination
├── repositories/   # BaseRepository[T] generic
├── middleware/     # Auth, CORS, RateLimit
├── logger/         # Structured logging
├── response/       # Standardized API responses
├── errors/         # Custom error types
├── validator/      # Input validation
└── utils/         # Common utilities
```

## 🚀 Migration Path to Microservices

### Phase 1: Current State (Modular Monolith)
- ✅ Domain boundaries defined
- ✅ Shared components extracted  
- ✅ Each domain has its own data models
- ✅ Domain-specific repositories and services
- ✅ Working monolith with clean architecture
- 🔄 Route integration (API layer to be added when extracting services)

### Phase 2: Extract Core Services
1. **Auth Service** - First to extract (all other services depend on it)
2. **Restaurant Service** - Core business entity
3. **Menu Service** - Can run independently

### Phase 3: Extract Feature Services
4. **QR Code Service** - High traffic, needs independent scaling
5. **Feedback Service** - Data-intensive, different storage needs
6. **Subscription Service** - Billing compliance requirements

### Phase 4: Add Infrastructure
- API Gateway (Kong, Traefik)
- Service Discovery (Consul, etcd)
- Message Queue (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- Distributed Tracing (Jaeger)
- Centralized Logging (ELK Stack)

## 📊 Benefits of Current Structure

1. **Independent Development** - Teams can work on separate domains
2. **Technology Flexibility** - Each service can use different tech stack
3. **Scalability** - Scale domains based on load
4. **Fault Isolation** - Issues in one domain don't affect others
5. **Easy Testing** - Test domains in isolation

## 🔄 Inter-Domain Communication

Currently using direct imports, but ready for:
- REST APIs between services
- gRPC for internal communication
- Event-driven architecture with message queues
- API Gateway for external access

## 📈 Deployment Options

Each domain can be:
- Deployed as separate Docker containers
- Run on different Kubernetes pods
- Scaled independently based on load
- Updated without affecting other services

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Local Development** - Run as monolith for simplicity
2. **Testing** - Test domains in isolation
3. **Staging** - Deploy as separate services
4. **Production** - Full microservices with monitoring

The architecture is ready for microservices deployment while maintaining the simplicity of monolithic development!
