## 🎯 What I'm Working On

### Questionnaire Builder
**Status**: 80% complete

**Done**:
- ✅ Question CRUD operations work
- ✅ Questionnaires managed directly from dish cards
- ✅ Dishes show questionnaire status
- ✅ Removed separate questionnaires section (simplified UX)
- ✅ Modal-based questionnaire editing

**Todo**:
- [ ] Drag-and-drop question ordering
- [ ] Question preview
- [ ] Question templates
- [ ] Bulk operations

## 🐛 Bugs to Fix
- Question ordering doesn't persist
- Settings page incomplete
- Email templates need work

## 💭 Ideas / Backlog
- Customer selects dish → sees questionnaire
- AI response analysis
- WhatsApp integration
- Multi-language support
- PWA with offline mode

## 📝 Quick Notes
- Using Svelte 5 runes everywhere
- Questionnaires are dish-specific (important!)
- Always check subscription limits

## 🔄 Last Session
- Fixed questionnaire editing
- Added dish-questionnaire UI
- Switched to Lucide icons
