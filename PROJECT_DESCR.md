# LeCritique - Restaurant Feedback Platform

## Project Overview

LeCritique is a SaaS platform that enables restaurants to collect detailed, dish-specific feedback from customers through QR code-driven questionnaires. The platform helps restaurant owners gain actionable insights to improve their service, menu offerings, and overall customer experience.

## Core Concept

1. **Restaurant owners** subscribe to the service (monthly fee)
2. **Generate QR codes** for tables, locations, or takeaway orders
3. **Customers scan** the QR code after their meal
4. **Select the dish** they ordered from the menu
5. **Answer targeted questions** specific to that dish
6. **Restaurant receives** real-time feedback and analytics

## Key Features

### For Restaurant Owners

- **Multi-restaurant support** - Manage multiple restaurant locations under one account
- **Subscription-based pricing** - Tiered plans based on restaurant count and features
- **QR code management** - Generate and manage QR codes for different purposes (tables, takeaway, delivery)
- **Dish catalog** - Maintain menu items with categories, prices, and availability
- **Custom questionnaires** - Create dish-specific questions or use templates
- **Real-time analytics** - View feedback trends, ratings, and insights
- **Team collaboration** - Invite team members with different permission levels
- **Low rating alerts** - Get notified when feedback falls below threshold

### For Customers

- **Frictionless experience** - No app download or registration required
- **Quick feedback** - Complete questionnaire in under 2 minutes
- **Dish-specific questions** - Relevant questions based on what they ordered
- **Multiple question types** - Ratings, scales, multiple choice, text feedback
- **Optional contact info** - Provide email/phone for follow-up (optional)
- **Mobile optimized** - Works seamlessly on any device

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.21+ with Echo framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with GORM ORM
- **Cache**: Redis for session management
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Architecture**: Monolith designed for easy microservices migration

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Monolith First, Microservices Ready**
   - All services in one codebase but organized by domain
   - Clear separation between domains for future extraction
   - Shared database with logical separation

2. **Multi-tenant Architecture**
   - Account-based isolation
   - Subscription limits enforced at service layer
   - Restaurant-level data separation

3. **UUID Primary Keys**
   - Better for distributed systems
   - No sequential ID exposure
   - Prevents ID enumeration attacks

4. **Repository Pattern**
   - Clean separation of data access logic
   - Easy to mock for testing
   - Database-agnostic interface

5. **Service Layer**
   - Business logic separated from HTTP handlers
   - Subscription limit enforcement
   - Cross-domain orchestration

## Domain Model

### Core Entities

1. **Account**
   - Represents a restaurant owner/company
   - Has subscription, restaurants, team members
   - Email-based authentication

2. **Restaurant**
   - Individual restaurant location
   - Belongs to an account
   - Has settings, locations, dishes, QR codes

3. **Dish**
   - Menu items with pricing and availability
   - Can have custom questionnaire
   - Tracks feedback per dish

4. **QRCode**
   - Unique codes for customer entry points
   - Types: table, location, takeaway, delivery
   - Tracks scan count and last scan time

5. **Feedback**
   - Customer responses to questionnaires
   - Links to dish, restaurant, and QR code
   - Stores ratings and text responses

6. **Subscription**
   - Controls account limits and features
   - Plans: Starter ($29), Professional ($79), Enterprise ($199)
   - Enforces restaurant count, feedback limits, etc.
